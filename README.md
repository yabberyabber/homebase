This playbook contains tasks for setting up a linux environment with all my dotfiles, plugins, etc. I've customized my development environment over the course of years and this set of scripts lets me install my configuration on a new host in a matter of seconds.

highlights:
 - installs vim-pathogen
 - installs nerdtree
 - installs vim-tmux-navigator (move seamlessly between tmux and vim panes with ctrl-h, ctrl-j, ctrl-k, ctrl-l)
 - installs tab completion for git branches in bash

To install locally, just run `run.sh`
